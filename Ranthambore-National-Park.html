            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Ranthambore National Park, located in the Sawai Madhopur district of Rajasthan, is one of the largest and most popular national parks in North India. Established in 1955 as the Sawai Madhopur Gaming Sanctuary, it was later declared as a Project Tiger Reserve in 1973 and became a national park in 1980. The park is known for its large population of tigers and other wildlife, making it a significant attraction for wildlife tourism in Rajasthan.Spread over an area of 1334 sq km, the Ranthambore National Park is divided into 10 zones, with zones 1-5 being the best for tiger sightings. The park is home to a variety of flora and fauna, including the Royal Bengal tiger, leopard, nilgai, wild boar, sambar, hyena, sloth bear, chital, and over 270 species of birds. The park's dense vegetation provides an ideal habitat for the tigers to hunt and stealthily move around, making it a prime destination for tiger tours.The park's history is closely linked to the Ranthambore Fort, which was built in 944 AD and was the territory of the famous Ranthambore tigress, Machali. The fort is now a popular tourist attraction, and the Trinetra Ganesh Temple, located inside the fort, is the oldest Ganesh shrine in Rajasthan.The best time to visit Ranthambore is from November to March, when all the safari gates are open. The park remains closed during the monsoon season, but tourists can still visit it during this time as a few gates are partially opened. The park is easily accessible by air, rail, and road, with Jaipur being the nearest airport, Sawai Madhopur being the nearest railway station, and Ranthambore being connected by road.In recent years, the tiger population in Ranthambore has increased from 59 in 2014 to 86 in 2022, thanks to government initiatives like Project Tiger and M-STrIPES. The park is not only a significant attraction for wildlife tourism but also a crucial part of India's tiger conservation efforts</p>
