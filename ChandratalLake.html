            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Chandratal Lake, also known as Chandra Tal or the Lake of the Moon, is a breathtaking natural wonder nestled in the southwestern Himalayas. Chandra Taal Lake is on the Samudra Tapu plateau, which overlooks the Chandra River (a source river of the Chenab). The name of the lake originates from its crescent shape.

            Some key features of Chandratal Lake include:
            Crescent Shape: The name “Chandra Tal” originates from its distinctive crescent shape. This serene lake curves gracefully, resembling a celestial crescent in the rugged mountain landscape.
            Altitude and Location: Chandra Tal sits at an impressive altitude of approximately 4,300 meters (14,100 feet) in the Himalayas. On one side of the lake, mountains of scree rise dramatically, creating a stunning backdrop.
            Access: Chandra Tal is accessible by road from Batal and can also be reached on foot from Kunzum Pass during the late spring to early October period. The motor road extends up to a parking lot about 1 kilometer (0.62 miles) from the lake, and from there, visitors need to walk the final stretch.
            Flora and Fauna: Wildflower Meadows: During springtime, the banks of Chandra Tal are carpeted with hundreds of varieties of wildflowers.
