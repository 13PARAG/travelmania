            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Church in Panjim, Goa, India is a captivating blend of architectural styles that harmoniously combine to create its distinctive personality.The church is located in Panjim and sits atop a hill facing the square below. The city's municipal garden (Garcia da orta) lies to its southeast and can be seen from atop the hill. 

            Some key features of the Church include:
            Architectural Fusion: The church's construction began in 1541 and was completed in 1609 over several centuries, incorporating various influences. The beautiful carvings on the exterior, the majestic entrance, and the gorgeous altar inside showcase this design.
            Exterior: The church's white facade, adorned with intricate details, signifies the Immaculate Virgin, Mary. Two flights of zigzag stairs ascend to the hillside where the church stands. The tall belfry, centered atop the facade, houses the ancient bell retrieved from the Augustinian ruins of the Church of Our Lady of Grace in Old Goa.
            Interior: Inside, the grandiosity is enhanced by towering ceilings and elaborate woodwork panels. The altar, serving as the room's focal point, is embellished with golden figures and decorations.
            Annual Celebration: On December 8, the church celebrates the annual feast of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception. The church, lit up at night, draws a large crowd of residents and visitors during this festive occasion.
