            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Hidimba Devi Temple, locally known as Dhungari Temple, also known variously as the Hadimba Temple, is located in Manāli, a hill station in the State of Himāchal Pradesh in north India. The temple is surrounded by a cedar forest called Dhungiri Van Vihar at the foot of the Himālayas. The sanctuary is built over a huge rock jutting out of the ground which was worshiped as an image of the deity. The structure was built in 1553 by Maharaja Bahadur Singh.

            Some key features of Hidimba Devi Temple include:
            Ancient Origins: Built in 1553 CE by Maharaja Bahadur Singh, this temple is dedicated to Hidimbi Devi, the wife of Bhima, a prominent figure from the Indian epic Mahābhārata. Legend has it that Hidimbi performed meditation in the cave where the temple now stands.
            Unique Architecture: Wooden Marvel: The temple features intricately carved wooden doors and a 24-meter-tall wooden shikhar (tower) above the sanctuary. Three Roofs: The tower has three square roofs covered with timber tiles and a fourth brass cone-shaped roof at the top. Whitewashed Stonework: The temple base is made of whitewashed, mud-covered stonework.
            Mythological Significance: Hidimbi, born into a Rakshasa family, vowed to marry the one who defeated her brother Hidimb, known for his bravery.
