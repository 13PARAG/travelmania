            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p> The Rani Sati Temple in Jhunjhunu, Rajasthan, is a significant religious site dedicated to Rani Sati, a Rajasthani woman who lived between the 13th and 17th centuries and performed sati (self-immolation) when her husband died. The temple is the largest in India devoted to Rani Sati and is a pilgrimage site for millions of devotees from various religious backgrounds, including Hindu, Muslim, Sikh, Christian, and Jain. The temple complex houses thirteen sati temples, with the main temple being the largest and most prominent.The temple is unique for its lack of paintings or statues of female or male gods, instead, devotees worship a trishul representing power and might. The temple's architecture is colonial-Rajput style, featuring arched colonnade corridors, symmetrical cemented railings on the roof, and life-size statues of Lord Krishna, Goddess Lakshmi, and Goddess Bhawani, along with lion and elephant figurines.The temple's history is deeply rooted in the story of Rani Sati, who is also known as Narayani Devi and Dadiji. The legend behind Rani Sati's sati is a significant aspect of the temple's significance, with her act of self-immolation being a symbol of devotion and sacrifice. The temple trustees organize a well-attended annual fair to commemorate Rani Sati, attracting thousands of pilgrims.The Rani Sati Temple has been a subject of controversy, particularly in 1980 when a public procession taken out by Rani Sati devotees in New Delhi to celebrate the construction of a new Rani Sati temple led to discussions in both houses of the Indian Parliament over the promotion of the practice of sati. The Indian government issued an order proscribing the 'glorification of Sati', and tried banning the annual fair at Jhunjhunu. However, the temple and its traditions continue to be an essential part of the cultural and religious identity of the Marwari community and other communities in Rajasthan and beyond
