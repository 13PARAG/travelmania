            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Palolem Beach, nestled in the serene Canacona region of South Goa, is renowned for its picturesque crescent-shaped shoreline, fringed by swaying coconut palms and colorful beach huts. From either end, you can enjoy panoramic views of the entire beach.

            Some key features of Palolem Beach include:
            Unspoiled Beauty: Palolem Beach remains largely unspoiled and is inhabited by both local fishermen and foreign tourists. The beach stretches for about one mile (approximately 1.61 km) and forms a gentle crescent shape.
            Safe Waters: The sea depth gradually increases, with the shallowest part at the northern end. This makes it safe for average swimmers, and the currents are not fast.
            Film Connection: Palolem Beach gained fame when it was featured in The Bourne Supremacy (2004) as the main character's Indian residence.
