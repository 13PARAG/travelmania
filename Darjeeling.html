            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>On a summer day, the fragrance of tea leaves lifts off the hills and hover over Darjeeling like a hat and the wonderful things breathes unsaid inside that, like the bent trees, the happy earthworms, the reluctant tea-colored puddles, flowering Rhododendrons and Magnolia plants and the wild garden flowers blooming in different colors of rainbow and a British bungalow growing a fragile façade of greenery for ages amidst a sprawling tea garden. Darjeeling tour packages offer an enchanting experience amidst the mesmerizing beauty of its tourist places, leaving travelers awestruck and captivated.
                The northwest winds visit Darjeeling to tear it full of holes but the new beautiful things come in the first spit of spring on the northwest wind, and the old leaves go, not one lasts but the beauty stays with the new and lasts for eternity. Darjeeling is a beauty that won’t let your heart stop, from beating in ecstasy, and the tourist places in Darjeeling shall always ensure that.
