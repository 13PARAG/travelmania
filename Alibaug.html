			<p>Alibaug is a coastal town located in the Raigad District of Maharashtra, India. It is situated along the west coast of India and is bordered by the Arabian Sea

                Alibaug and its surrounding villages are the historic hinterlands of Bene Israeli Jews. There is a synagogue in the “Israel Ali” area of the town. A Bene Israelite named Ali used to live there at that time. He was a rich man and owned many plantations of mangoes and coconuts in his gardens. Hence the locals used to call the place “Alichi Bagh” (Marathi for “Ali’s Garden”), or simply “Alibaug”

Rainfall is heavy from June to September, and usually, the catamaran/speed services are closed during this time.
