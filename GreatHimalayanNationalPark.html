            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This National Park in the western part of the Himalayan Mountains in the northern Indian state of Himachal Pradesh is characterized by high alpine peaks, alpine meadows and riverine forests.The Great Himalayan National Park (GHNP), a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is a pristine natural area that spans 754 square kilometers. It encompasses an elevation range from 1,500 meters to 6,000 meters and is home to a rich biodiversity of flora and fauna. 

            Some key features of Great Himalayan National Park include:
            The park was established in 1984 and is spread over an area of 1171 km2; elevations within the park range between 1500 and 6000 m. 
            The Great Himalayan National Park is a habitat to numerous flora and more than 375 fauna species, including approximately 31 mammals, 181 birds, 3 reptiles, 9 amphibians, 11 annelids, 17 mollusks and 127 insects.    
            Most of the Himalayan fauna has been given protection under the high priority protection category of Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. The state government of Himachal Pradesh has banned hunting in the state for more than ten years. 
            A trek of 35 to 45 km in any of the park's valleys brings one into the high elevation habitat (3,500 m and above) of animals such as blue sheep, snow leopard, Himalayan brown bear, Himalayan tahr, and musk deer.
