            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The St. Sebastian Chapel in Fontainhas, Goa is a charming testament to the region's rich Christian heritage and architectural prowess. The pristine white structure is dedicated to St. Sebastian who treated the ones affected by plague and other diseases.The church houses a crucifix where one can find Christ's eyes are open for striking fear into the minds and hearts of the wrongdoers.

            Some key features of St Sebastian Chapel include:
            Historical Significance: Built in 1818, this quaint chapel is dedicated to St. Sebastian. During the years of the plague in Old Goa, people prayed to St. Sebastian for deliverance from trouble caused by pests and rodents.
            Exterior: The chapel's pristine white facade stands in contrast to the colorful neighborhood. A striking crucifix, originally from the Palace of Inquisition in Old Goa, adorns the church. In this crucifix, Christ’s eyes are open.
            Interior: Inside, the chapel boasts a small nave connected to a narrow corridor. A winding staircase within the corridor leads visitors to the choir room perched above.
            Annual Street Feast: The St. Sebastian Chapel dominates a small square where locals used to hold a lively annual street feast. This celebration occurs each mid-November to honor the Feast of Our Lady of Livrament.
