            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Spiti Valley, nestled in the Himalayan region, is a captivating destination with unique characteristics. A mountainous cold desert freckled with green patches over a dry weather-beaten face, fascinating valleys, windswept landscapes and quiet villages. Spiti, which loosely translates as 'the middle land'.

            Some key features of Spiti Valley include:
            Mountainous Cold Desert: Spiti resembles a cold desert, marked by rugged terrain, barren mountains, and vast expanses. Its weather-beaten face is freckled with green patches, creating a striking contrast.
            Cultural Influence: The valley lies at the crossroads of India and Tibet, resulting in a heavy influence of Buddhism. Stark cultural similarities permeate the region, evident in monasteries, mani stones, whitewashed chortens, and fluttering prayer flags.
            Climate: Spiti's high altitudes maintain sub-zero temperatures. While May-June sees temperatures around 15-20°C, deep winter (December-February) can plummet to -20°C in some places. Pack warm clothing even during favorable months.
            Surreal Moonscapes: The valley's surreal beauty includes moonscapes, scenic Himalayan lakes, and the harsh highlands nourished by prayers. The glacial Spiti River weaves through, sustaining life.
