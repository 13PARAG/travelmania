            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>Jaigarh Fort, located in Jaipur, Rajasthan, is a magnificent structure built by Sawan Jai Singh II in 1726 AD on the Hill of Eagles. The fort is spread over 3 kilometres in length and a kilometre in width, making it the strongest of the three forts in Jaipur. It is known as the 'Victory Fort' because it was never conquered by enemies.The fort is made entirely of red sandstone, which is composed of dressed stone held together with lime. It houses the world's biggest cannon on wheels, known as 'Jaivana', which is 20.19 feet long and weighs 50 tonnes. The cannon has a diameter of 11 inches and is mounted on wheels with a mechanism of two back wheels mounted on roller pin bearings, allowing it to turn 360° and fire in any direction. The cannon had a range of 22 miles and used 50 kilograms (110 lb) balls.Jaigarh Fort is built with thick walls and beautiful carvings, reflecting the rich culture and heritage of the city. It houses several exquisite architectural gems such as Aram Mandir, Lalit Mandir, Laxmi Vilas and Vilas Mandir. The fort also has two ancient temples, Ram Harihar and Kal Bhairav, built in the 10th and 12th centuries, respectively.The fort's cannon foundry was one of the world's most efficient, mainly due to the abundance of iron ore mines in the vicinity. The foundry had a massive wind tunnel that sucked air from the high mountains into its furnace, creating heated air that melted the metal. The molten metal would fill a reservoir chamber and pass into a cannon mold in the casting pit. The Rajputs built a large ingenious mechanical device that had a precision gear system driven by four pairs of oxen, which was used for hollowing out the cannon barrels.The fort's armoury chamber has a wide display of shields, swords, guns, time bombs, camel-mounted guns, muskets and also a 50 kilograms (110 lb) cannonball. The fort's museum showcases a hand-drawn blueprint or image of the fort and the palace within the museum premises.Jaigarh Fort is a year-round destination, offering unique experiences every season. The best time to visit is during the cooler months of November to February, when the pleasant weather enhances the fort exploration experience. The fort is open from 09:00 hours to 18:30 hours throughout the week, but it is not advised to stay here in the evening due to the presence of wild animals in the surrounding forest.In conclusion, Jaigarh Fort is a testament to the architectural brilliance and military might of the Rajputs. Its massive cannon, Jaivana, and the ingenious mechanical device used for hollowing out cannon barrels showcase the innovation in ancient warfare. The fort's exquisite architecture, thick walls, and beautiful carvings reflect the rich culture and heritage of the city. The fort's armoury chamber and museum provide insights into the military life of Jai Singh II and the lavish lifestyle of the era. Overall, Jaigarh Fort is a must-visit destination for anyone wanting to experience the essence of Rajput's bravery and architectural brilliance.</p>
