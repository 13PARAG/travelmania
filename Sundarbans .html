            <h2>Attractions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Boat Tour of the Mangrove Forest:- Boat Tours of the mangrove forest are the only way to properly explore the depths of Sundarbans as there are no jeep safaris here. Early morning boat rides through the creeks and canals are the best time to watch the animals and birds. It is recommended that these boat tours are done in smaller groups as large groups can frighten away animals and birds.</li>
                <li>Marichjhanpi:- Marichjhanpi is one of the islands within India�۪s most famous mangroves - the Sundarbans. Being the location for Amitav Ghosh�۪s novel The Hungry Tide and a Bengali movie that is due to be released in 2020, Marichjhanpi is known as an island of atrocities.</li>
                <li>Sajnekhali Bird Sanctuary:- Avid bird watchers can visit Sajnekhali Bird Sanctuary situated within Sundarbans National Park. Here many bird species can be observed freely within the lush greenery. Some species that can be spotted here include kingfishers, open billed storks, White Bellied Sea Eagle, Paradise Flycatcher, and the rare Asian Dowitchers.</li>
                <!-- <li>Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park:- Established in 1958, this zoological park is home to several rare and endangered species like the red panda, snow leopard, and Himalayan wolf.
